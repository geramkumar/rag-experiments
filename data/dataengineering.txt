Agentic AI refers to intelligent systems that can autonomously plan, decide, and execute actions toward specific predefined goals without constant human supervision.
Unlike traditional software programs, an agent observes its environment, reasons about possible outcomes, and selects the most appropriate action dynamically.
The main purpose of agentic systems is reducing manual effort while improving decision-making efficiency in complex workflows.
These systems typically include memory components, reasoning engines, and the ability to call external tools or APIs.
An AI agent can interact with databases, web services, or enterprise applications to complete assigned objectives.
Planning capabilities allow the agent to decompose large tasks into smaller manageable steps before execution.
Reactive agents respond immediately to stimuli, whereas deliberative agents evaluate multiple possibilities before acting.
Multi-agent architectures enable several autonomous entities to collaborate and solve shared organizational problems effectively.
The concept of ＡＩ-driven autonomy is transforming how businesses design intelligent automation solutions.
Agentic paradigms represent a shift from passive prediction models toward proactive digital assistants capable of independent execution.

A database management system is software designed to store, organize, and retrieve structured information efficiently.
The main purpose of a DBMS is ensuring consistency, durability, and secure multi-user access to data.
Relational database systems structure data into tables composed of rows and columns with defined relationships.
Structured Query Language, commonly called SQL, enables users to manipulate and query stored records effectively.
Transaction management enforces ACID properties to guarantee reliable processing even during unexpected failures.
Indexing mechanisms accelerate data retrieval by reducing the amount of scanned information.
Concurrency control techniques prevent conflicts when multiple transactions access the same dataset simultaneously.
Backup and recovery procedures protect organizations from accidental deletion or hardware malfunctions.
Modern database systems include distributed, cloud-native, and NoSQL architectures for scalability.
Database management solutions power applications ranging from financial systems to large-scale e-commerce platforms.

Agentic AI systems can automate customer support operations by interpreting intent and responding appropriately.
These intelligent agents analyze context before selecting suitable actions from multiple possible alternatives.
Task-oriented agents follow structured workﬂow definitions while still adapting dynamically to new conditions.
